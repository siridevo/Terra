Specifies the name to attach to the role session. This value is provided to the RoleSessionName
parameter when the AWS CLI calls the AssumeRole operation, and becomes part of the assumed
role user ARN: arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/role_name/role_session_name.
This is an optional parameter. If you do not provide this value, a session name is generated
automatically. This name appears in AWS CloudTrail logs for entries associated with this session.
  
Specifies the path to a file that contains an OAuth 2.0 access token or OpenID Connect ID token that
is provided by an identity provider. The AWS CLI loads the contents of this file and passes it as the
WebIdentityToken argument to the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity operation.
